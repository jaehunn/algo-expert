The distance between a node in Binary Tree and the tree's root is called the node's depth.

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns the sum of its node's depth.

Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node.
Children nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None / null.
