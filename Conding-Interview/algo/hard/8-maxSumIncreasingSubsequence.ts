/**
 * Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers and returns the greatest sum that can be genereated from a strictly-increasing subsequence in the array
 * as well as an array of the numbers in that subsequence.
 *
 * A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array
 * but that are in the same order as they appear in the array.
 *
 * For instnace, the numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4], and so do the nubmers [2, 4].
 *
 * Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.
 *
 * You can assume that there will only be one increasing subsequence with the greatest sum.
